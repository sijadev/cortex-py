# ADR-004: Multi-Vault + AI-Learning Architecture

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Date:** 2025-08-10  
**Confidence:** 88% 🟢  
**Supersedes:** ADR-003 (Hybrid-Workspace wird durch Multi-Vault ersetzt)

## 🎯 **Decision**

Cortex evolves to **Multi-Vault + AI-Learning Architecture** where each project becomes a separate Obsidian vault, connected through intelligent tag-based AI learning system.

## 📋 **Context**

**Problem with Hybrid-Workspace Approach:**
- Single vault becomes cluttered with multiple projects
- Namespace conflicts and performance issues
- Limited isolation between projects
- Scaling issues with growing number of projects

**New Requirements:**
- Complete project isolation
- Intelligent cross-project learning
- Scalable architecture for unlimited projects
- AI-driven pattern recognition across vaults

├── 00-Meta/
│   ├── Project-Profile.md         # Standardized project metadata
│   ├── Tag-Schema.md             # Project-specific tag definitions
│   └── Vault-Links.md            # Links to other relevant vaults
├── 01-Planning/                  # Project planning & strategy
├── 02-Development/               # Development logs & progress
├── 03-Decisions/                 # Project-specific ADRs
├── 04-Resources/                 # Project resources & references
├── 05-Insights/                  # Project-specific learnings
└── 99-Archive/                   # Completed/archived items
```
