# Quality-Gates

## Overview

Quality Gates define the criteria and checkpoints that ensure consistent quality standards across all Cortex system components. These gates operate at different levels of the development and content creation lifecycle.

#### Review Process

1. **Automated Assignment**: Based on content type and expertise
2. **Review Timeline**: 48-72 hours for standard content, 5+ days for major decisions
3. **Feedback Integration**: Authors must address all feedback before approval
4. **Approval Tracking**: Digital signatures and timestamps

### 3. Integration Gate

**Purpose**: Verify that changes integrate properly with the broader system.

#### Integration Tests

- **Cross-Reference Validation**: New content properly links to related materials
- **System Consistency**: Changes don't break existing workflows
- **Navigation Integrity**: Content is discoverable through standard navigation
- **Search Integration**: Content is properly indexed and searchable

#### Automated Checks

```bash
# Example integration validation
./test-manager-enhanced.sh link-validation --comprehensive
./test-manager-enhanced.sh cross-reference-check
./test-manager-enhanced.sh navigation-integrity
```

#### Success Criteria

- All automated integration tests pass
- No broken links introduced
- Proper bidirectional linking established
- Content accessible through expected pathways

### 4. AI Suggestion Validation Gate

**Purpose**: Validate AI-generated link suggestions before application.

#### Validation Criteria

##### Confidence-Based Processing

- **â‰¥90% Confidence**: Auto-apply with monitoring
- **80-89% Confidence**: Require human review and approval
- **70-79% Confidence**: Flag for expert review
- **<70% Confidence**: Reject automatically

##### Quality Checks

- **Semantic Context**: Suggested link maintains original meaning
- **File Existence**: Target file exists and is accessible
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: No circular references created
- **Template Compliance**: Link fits existing template structure
- **Domain Consistency**: Suggestion aligns with document domain

#### Validation Process

1. **Automated Screening**: Filter suggestions by confidence threshold
2. **Context Analysis**: Verify semantic similarity claims
3. **Technical Validation**: Confirm target file accessibility
4. **Human Review**: Manual approval for medium-confidence suggestions
5. **Application Tracking**: Monitor applied suggestions for effectiveness

#### Validation Tools

- `ai-link-advisor.py validate` - Automated validation pipeline
- Context similarity analyzers
- File existence checkers
- Cross-reference validators

#### Success Metrics

- **Validation Accuracy**: >95% correct acceptance/rejection decisions
- **Processing Time**: <2 minutes for automated validation
- **Human Review Quality**: <5% false positives in approved suggestions
- **Applied Suggestion Success**: >90% of applied suggestions remain valid after 30 days

### 5. Security Gate

**Purpose**: Ensure security considerations are properly addressed.

#### Security Validation Types

##### Content Security

- **Sensitive Information**: No credentials, keys, or PII in documentation
- **Access Control**: Proper classification and access restrictions
- **Compliance**: Adherence to regulatory requirements

##### System Security

- **Authentication Integration**: Proper auth integration for tools and systems
- **Data Protection**: Encryption and data handling compliance
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of access and changes

#### Security Tools

- Automated secret scanning (git-secrets, truffleHog)
- Access control validation
- Compliance checkers (GDPR, SOC2)
- Security policy validation

    confidence_threshold: 80
    security_review: required
  
  general_documentation:
    peer_reviewers: 1
    confidence_threshold: 70
    security_review: conditional

    peer_reviewers: 1
    confidence_threshold: 60
    security_review: false
  
  ai_suggestions:
    auto_apply_threshold: 90
    review_required_threshold: 80
    expert_review_threshold: 70
    reject_threshold: 70
```
