# üöÄ Cortex Quick Resume

*Zero-Context-Loss session resumption for Claude*

## ‚ö° **IMMEDIATE CONTEXT (Copy-Paste f√ºr neue Claude-Session)**

```markdown
CORTEX v2.0 STATUS BRIEF:

üîó SYSTEM CONNECTION: /Users/simonjanke/Projects/cortex
ü§ñ SERVICE STATUS: Cortex Learning Service ACTIVE (PID running)
üì° OBSIDIAN API: Connected on port 27124
‚ö° COMMANDS: All cortex tools immediately available
üõ°Ô∏è DECISION GATES: Quality enforcement active (75% confidence minimum)

‚úÖ COMPLETED: 
- Cortex v2.0 Architecture fully designed and validated
- Quantitative confidence algorithm implemented and tested
- Enhanced templates (ADR, Decision-Tracking, Performance-Dashboard) created
- Project-encapsulation strategy decided: Hybrid-Workspace-Approach (78.1% confidence)

üü° CURRENT TASK: Phase 1 Template-Enhancement Implementation
üìç EXACT NEXT ACTION: Create Project-Workspace template for hybrid-workspace approach
üìÅ TARGET FILE: /00-Templates/Project-Workspace.md

üîç KEY CONTEXT FILES:
- State-Management.md (complete session context)
- /03-Decisions/ADR-003-Projekt-Kapselung.md (approved decision)
- /00-System/Algorithms/confidence_calculator.py (working algorithm)

‚ö†Ô∏è NO RESEARCH NEEDED: All analysis complete, direct implementation ready
‚è±Ô∏è ESTIMATED TIME: 4-6 hours for Phase 1 completion
```

## üìã **Session-Recovery-Checklist**

### For Human (quick verification):
- [ ] Check State-Management.md f√ºr complete context
- [ ] Verify ADR-003 exists and is approved  
- [ ] Confirm confidence_calculator.py is working
- [ ] Ready to implement templates (no further research)

### For Claude (resumption-steps):
1. **Connect to Cortex**: Use path /Users/simonjanke/Projects/cortex
2. **Verify Obsidian connection**: obsidian:search_notes working
3. **Check service status**: Cortex Learning Service should be running
4. **Read State-Management.md** for complete context
5. **Skip all research** - decisions already made with 78.1% confidence
6. **Start immediate implementation** of Project-Workspace template

## üéØ **Quick-Action-Summary**

**WHAT**: Implement Cortex v2.0 Template-Enhancement (Phase 1)
**WHY**: Enable hybrid-workspace project-encapsulation (ADR-003 approved)
**HOW**: Create templates, test with pilot project, measure performance
**WHEN**: Ready now (all prerequisites completed)
