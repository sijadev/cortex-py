## Synthesis & Integration

### Key Insights Discovered:

#### 1. **Dataview Query Patterns for Project Workspaces**:

**Basic Project Overview**:
```dataview
TABLE status, priority, owner, date(file.ctime) as "Created"
FROM "01-Projects"
WHERE contains(tags, "projekt")
SORT priority DESC, file.ctime DESC
```

**Active Tasks by Project**:
```dataview
TABLE 
    length(filter(file.tasks, (t) => !t.completed)) as "Open Tasks",
    length(filter(file.tasks, (t) => t.completed)) as "Completed",
    round((length(filter(file.tasks, (t) => t.completed)) / length(file.tasks)) * 100) + "%" as "Progress"
FROM "01-Projects" 
WHERE file.tasks
SORT length(filter(file.tasks, (t) => !t.completed)) DESC
```

**Project Health Dashboard**:
```dataview
TABLE 
    confidence as "Confidence",
    status,
    choice(confidence > 80, "🟢", choice(confidence > 60, "🟡", "🔴")) as "Health",
    date(file.mtime) as "Last Updated"
FROM "03-Decisions"
WHERE contains(projekt, this.file.name)
SORT confidence DESC
```

#### 2. **Template Variable Examples**:

**Project Metadata Template**:
```markdown
---
project-name: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
project-type: {{PROJECT_TYPE}}
status: {{STATUS}}
priority: {{PRIORITY}}
owner: {{OWNER}}
start-date: {{START_DATE}}
tags: [projekt/{{PROJECT_NAME}}, {{PROJECT_TYPE}}, status/{{STATUS}}]
---
```

**Dynamic Cross-References**:
```dataview
LIST
FROM [[{{PROJECT_NAME}}]]
WHERE !contains(file.path, "99-Archive")
SORT file.mtime DESC
```

#### 3. **Real-World Project Workspace Examples**:

**Software Development Project**:
```dataview
TABLE 
    language,
    functionality,
    reuse_potential,
    choice(reuse_potential > 80, "🔄 High", choice(reuse_potential > 50, "🔄 Medium", "🔄 Low")) as "Reuse"
FROM "04-Code-Fragments"
WHERE contains(project, "{{PROJECT_NAME}}")
SORT reuse_potential DESC
```

**Research Project Tracking**:
```dataview
TABLE 
    research_completeness + "%" as "Research",
    source_count as "Sources",
    choice(research_completeness > 80, "✅", choice(research_completeness > 50, "🟡", "❌")) as "Status"
FROM "01-Projects"
WHERE contains(tags, "data-source") AND contains(file.path, "{{PROJECT_NAME}}")
```

#### 4. **Project Performance Metrics**:

**Decision Quality by Project**:
```dataview
TABLE 
    round(average(rows.confidence)) as "Avg Confidence",
    length(rows) as "Decisions Made",
    length(filter(rows, (r) => r.confidence > 80)) as "High Confidence"
FROM "03-Decisions"
WHERE contains(projekt, "{{PROJECT_NAME}}")
GROUP BY projekt
```

**Neural Link Sessions Analysis**:
```dataview
TABLE 
    ai_insights_quality as "AI Quality",
    session_focus as "Focus",
    date(file.ctime) as "Date",
    choice(ai_insights_quality > 80, "🧠 Excellent", choice(ai_insights_quality > 60, "🧠 Good", "🧠 Review")) as "Quality"
FROM "02-Neural-Links"
WHERE contains(project, "{{PROJECT_NAME}}")
SORT file.ctime DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Recommended Actions:

```dataview
TABLE status, research_completeness, source_count
FROM "01-Projects"
WHERE contains(file.path, "API Rate Limiter")
AND contains(tags, "data-source")
SORT file.ctime DESC
```

### Decisions (Architecture & Design)
```dataview
TABLE confidence, status, decision_type, date(file.ctime) as "Date"
FROM "03-Decisions"
WHERE contains(projekt, "API Rate Limiter")
SORT confidence DESC
```
```

### Example 2: Research Project

**Project**: Database Performance Analysis  
**Enhanced Dataview Queries**:

```dataview
# Research Progress Tracking
TABLE 
    research_completeness + "%" as "Progress",
    source_count as "Sources",
    expert_validation_status as "Expert Review",
    choice(research_completeness > 80, "✅ Complete",

## Template Enhancement Recommendations

### 1. **Interactive Project Dashboard**

Add this enhanced section to Project-Workspace template:

```markdown
## 🎯 **Live Project Dashboard**

### **Quick Stats**
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
    choice(length(file.tasks) > 0, 
           round((length(filter(file.tasks, (t) => t.completed)) / length(file.tasks)) * 100) + "%", 
           "No tasks") as "Completion",
    length(filter(file.tasks, (t) => !t.completed)) as "Open Tasks",
    choice(file.mtime > (date(today) - dur(7 days)), "🟢 Active", "🟡 Stale") as "Activity"
WHERE file.path = this.file.path
```

### **Related Projects** 
```dataview
LIST
FROM "01-Projects"
WHERE contains(tags, "projekt") 
AND file.path != this.file.path
AND any(tags, (t) => contains(string(this.tags), t))
SORT file.mtime DESC
LIMIT 3
```
```

### 2. **Smart Context Awareness**

```markdown
## 🧠 **AI Learning Integration**

### **Suggested Improvements**
```dataview
LIST
FROM "05-Insights"
WHERE contains(improvement_suggestions, "{{PROJECT_NAME}}")
OR contains(applicable_projects, "{{PROJECT_NAME}}")
SORT confidence DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### **Similar Successful Patterns**
```dataview
TABLE 
    pattern_name as "Pattern",
    confidence + "%" as "Success Rate",
    reuse_potential + "%" as "Applicability"
FROM "05-Insights"
WHERE contains(tags, "auto-detected")
AND reuse_potential > 70
SORT confidence DESC
LIMIT 3
```
```

### 3. **Automated Quality Gates**

```markdown
## ✅ **Quality Checkpoints**

### **Automated Health Check**
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
    choice(length(filter(rows, (r) => r.confidence > 70)) / length(rows) > 0.8, "✅", "❌") as "Decision Quality",
    choice(length(filter(rows, (r) => contains(r.tags, "data-source"))) > 2, "✅", "❌") as "Research Depth",
    choice(file.mtime > (date(today) - dur(14 days)), "✅", "❌") as "Recent Activity",
    choice(length(file.outlinks) > 3, "✅", "❌") as "Cross-References"
FROM "03-Decisions" OR "01-Projects"
WHERE contains(file.path, "{{PROJECT_NAME}}")
GROUP BY true
```
```
